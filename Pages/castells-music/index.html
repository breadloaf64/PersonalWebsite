                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm trying to create an English language resource for
                    someone learning to play music for
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell">castells</a
                    >. I'm sure there's plenty of good stuff online, but as a
                    non-catalan speaker, I find it hard to locate, let alone
                    understand! Now, I am not of the Catalan culture and I only
                    started taking part in Castells in the summer of 2023, so I
                    cannot claim to authentically represent traditions and
                    culture. Any mistakes are my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to David Vivanco for teaching me all I know about
                    castells music.

                    things to move and shift and change, but please use it for
                    your learning if it helps!

                <h2 id="the-gralla">The Gralla</h2>

                <p>
                    The gralla is the main melody instrument in castells music.
                    It is a double reeded instrument like an oboe, and it is
                    remarkably loud - which makes it very easy for the the
                    castellers to hear it, even outside in a crowded square. It
                    shares its name with the jackdaw.
                </p>

                <p>The gralla is made up of several parts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The inxa</strong>, also known as the canya, is
                        the set of two reeds that product the instrument's
                        sound. The reeds are delicately thin and bound together
                        in a coloured thred. The colour of the thread indicates
                        how hard the reeds are to play.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The tudel</strong> is a metal conical tube that
                        joins the inxa to the body of the instrument. Usually it
                        is attached to a cork on one end which slots into the
                        body, and the inxa gets pushed onto the pointy end.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The cos</strong> is the main body of the
                        instrument.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The campana</strong> is the end of the
                        instrument, which amplifies the sound.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Taking care of the gralla</h3>

                <p>
                    There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to keep
                    your gralla in the best condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Storing the inxa: </strong> The inxa is a delicate
                    piece of wood. If it breaks or becomes mishapen, it won't
                    sound effectively and you will have to replace it. It is
                    worth detaching from the instrument after each use and
                    storing in a rigid case. I keep mine in a small sewing tin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Cleaning: </strong> It is worth running a cloth
                    through the instrument to remove moisture buildup. There are
                    handy "pull-through" or "swab" cloths you can buy, usually
                    for clarinets, which have a long string with a weight on the
                    end to make it easier to pass through the instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can sterilise the inxa and prevent mould by dipping it
                    in alcohol. Whisky does the trick!
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are the basic notes for the gralla and flabiol. For
                    the fingering diagrams, a black circle represents a covered
                    hole (put your finger down), and a white circle represents
                    an open cole (lift your finger up). The topmost circle
                    represents the thumb hold on the bottom of the instrument.
                </p>

                    Note: &nbsp This is not written to concert pitch! This means
                    that the 'c' or 'do' on your instrument might not be the
                    same as one on a different instrument.

                <p>
                    Inana is also known as "La Cosa Està Negra", or "Ailala" It
                    is a good and quite simple tune to learn first.

                <p>
                    Polca d'ours, known in the UK as "Bear Dance" is usually
                    played at the end of a castells performance, for a
                    particular dance (see first video).

                <p>
                    The toc de castells is the tune to play during a castells
                    performance. Its main purpose is to communicate to those in
                    the tower (who cannot see) what stage the tower is in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each colla can have their own interpretation of the tune,
                    which is why you will find different groups playing it
                    slightly differently. However the main theme is instantly
                    recognisable. For now, in the Edinburgh colla, we will adopt
                    the arrangement used by the
